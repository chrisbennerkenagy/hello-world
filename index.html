                    Hello! My name is Lacy. I am a 45lb dog. I am a Pitbull mutt. I am 6 years old, although my partents continue to call me 4 years old. I live in Seattle WA. Which is absolutely fine in the summer but I am really not too sure about all this cold wet weather during the other months. Good thing I have lots of blankets and get any bed, couch, or spot I want. 
                </p>
